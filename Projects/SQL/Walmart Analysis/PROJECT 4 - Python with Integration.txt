PROJECT 4 - Python with Integration of SQL

Walmart Data Analysis: End-to-End SQL + Python Project

This project is an end-to-end data analysis solution designed to extract critical business insights from Walmart sales data. We utilize Python for data processing and analysis, SQL for advanced querying, and structured problem-solving techniques to solve key business questions. The project is ideal for data analysts looking to develop skills in data manipulation, SQL querying, and data pipeline creation.

To Find:-
1. Analyze Payment Methods and Sales
● Question: What are the different payment methods, and how many transactions and
items were sold with each method?
● Purpose: This helps understand customer preferences for payment methods, aiding in
payment optimization strategies.


2. Identify the Highest-Rated Category in Each Branch
● Question: Which category received the highest average rating in each branch?
● Purpose: This allows Walmart to recognize and promote popular categories in specific
branches, enhancing customer satisfaction and branch-specific marketing.


3. Determine the Busiest Day for Each Branch
● Question: What is the busiest day of the week for each branch based on transaction
volume?
● Purpose: This insight helps in optimizing staffing and inventory management to
accommodate peak days.


4. Calculate Total Quantity Sold by Payment Method
● Question: Calculate the total quantity of items sold per payment method ?
● Purpose: This helps Walmart track sales volume by payment type, providing insights
into customer purchasing habits.


5. Analyze Category Ratings by City
● Question: Determine the average, minimum, and maximum rating of categories for each city
● Purpose: This data can guide city-level promotions, allowing Walmart to address
regional preferences and improve customer experiences.


6. Calculate Total Profit by Category
● Question: Calculate the total profit for each category
● Purpose: Identifying high-profit categories helps focus efforts on expanding these
products or managing pricing strategies effectively.


7. Determine the Most Common Payment Method per Branch
● Question: What is the most frequently used payment method in each branch?
● Purpose: This information aids in understanding branch-specific payment preferences,
potentially allowing branches to streamline their payment processing systems.


8. Analyze Sales Shifts Throughout the Day
● Question: How many transactions occur in each shift (Morning, Afternoon, Evening)
across branches?
● Purpose: This insight helps in managing staff shifts and stock replenishment schedules,
especially during high-sales periods.


9. Identify Branches with Highest Revenue Decline Year-Over-Year
● Question: Which branches experienced the largest decrease in revenue compared to
the previous year?
● Purpose: Detecting branches with declining revenue is crucial for understanding
possible local issues and creating strategies to boost sales or mitigate losses.



-- Explore the Data
   - *Goal*: Conduct an initial data exploration to understand data distribution, check column names, types, and identify potential issues.
   - *Analysis*: Use functions like `.info()`, `.describe()`, and `.head()` to get a quick overview of the data structure and statistics.

-- Data Cleaning
   - **Remove Duplicates**: Identify and remove duplicate entries to avoid skewed results.
   - **Handle Missing Values**: Drop rows or columns with missing values if they are insignificant; fill values where essential.
   - **Fix Data Types**: Ensure all columns have consistent data types (e.g., dates as `datetime`, prices as `float`).
   - **Currency Formatting**: Use `.replace()` to handle and format currency values for analysis.
   - **Validation**: Check for any remaining inconsistencies and verify the cleaned data.

-- Feature Engineering
   - **Create New Columns**: Calculate the `Total Amount` for each transaction by multiplying `unit_price` by `quantity` and adding this as            a new column.
   - **Enhance Dataset**: Adding this calculated field will streamline further SQL analysis and aggregation tasks.

-- Load Data into MySQL and PostgreSQL
   - **Set Up Connections**: Connect to MySQL and PostgreSQL using `sqlalchemy` and load the cleaned data into each database.
   - **Table Creation**: Set up tables in both MySQL and PostgreSQL using Python SQLAlchemy to automate table creation and data insertion.
   - **Verification**: Run initial SQL queries to confirm that the data has been loaded accurately.

-- SQL Analysis: Complex Queries and Business Problem Solving
   - **Business Problem-Solving**: Write and execute complex SQL queries to answer critical business questions, such as:
     - Revenue trends across branches and categories.
     - Identifying best-selling product categories.
     - Sales performance by time, city, and payment method.
     - Analyzing peak sales periods and customer buying patterns.
     - Profit margin analysis by branch and category.
